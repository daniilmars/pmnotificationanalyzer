# UI Features: Quality Analysis Section

This document explains the functionality of the "Refined Actionable List" feature in the "Quality Analysis" tab of the application.

The goal of this UI is to make the AI's feedback more organized, easier to read, and directly actionable.

### How It Works

1.  **Structured Problem List:**
    *   Instead of a single block of text, the identified problems are displayed as a clear, vertical list. Each problem has its own line, making it much easier to scan and understand individual issues.
    *   The problem description itself is plain text, so you can read it without accidentally triggering any action.

2.  **Dedicated Navigation Icon:**
    *   Next to each problem description, you'll see a small **navigation icon** (a right-pointing arrow). This icon is the key to the "actionable" part of the list.
    *   This dedicated icon makes it explicit that clicking it will take you somewhere, providing a clearer user experience than making the entire text clickable.

3.  **Intelligent Click-to-Navigate Functionality:**
    *   When you click on one of these navigation icons, the UI intelligently guides you to the relevant part of the application where you can address that specific problem.
    *   **Tab Switching:** If the problem is related to a different tab (e.g., a work order issue while you're on the "Notification Details" tab), the application will automatically switch to the correct tab for you.
    *   **Scrolling to Section:** Once on the correct tab, the view will smoothly scroll to the specific section that contains the field needing attention (e.g., the "Long Text" area, the "Codes" form, or the "Work Order Details" form).
    *   **Field Highlighting:** To make it even clearer, the relevant input field or section will briefly **highlight** with a subtle animation, drawing your eye directly to where you need to make a change.

### Summary of Benefits

*   **Clarity:** Problems are presented in a clean, itemized list.
*   **Control:** You decide when and if you want to navigate to a field by clicking the dedicated icon.
*   **Guidance:** The application actively helps you find and focus on the areas that require your attention, streamlining the process of improving notification quality.
