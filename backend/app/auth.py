# This file can be completely removed if no authentication is desired.
# For now, we'll keep it as an empty placeholder or with minimal content
# to avoid breaking imports in other files if they still reference it.

# If you choose to remove this file, ensure no other files import 'app.auth'
# For example, in main.py, remove 'from app.auth import token_required'

# You might keep a very minimal version if you foresee re-introducing auth later:
"""
Placeholder for authentication logic.
Authentication has been temporarily removed from the application.
"""
# No authentication logic is implemented in this version.
