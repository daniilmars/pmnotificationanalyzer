## Application Overview

The PM Notification Quality Assistant aims to proactively enhance the quality of Plant Maintenance notifications, particularly in highly regulated environments like pharmaceutical production. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence, the application identifies deficiencies in documentation, provides actionable insights, and supports a continuous improvement process (KVP). It's designed for a range of users, ensuring that maintenance records are audit-proof and compliant with stringent data integrity principles (ALCOA+).

> **Note:** This version of the application has authentication completely removed for simplified deployment and demonstration purposes.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Quality Analysis:** Automated evaluation of maintenance notification texts based on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and ALCOA+ principles.
- **Quantitative Scoring:** Each analysis provides a numerical quality score (0-100) for quick assessment.
- **Detailed Problem Identification:** The AI highlights specific issues and gaps in the notification documentation.
- **Summarized Expert Assessment:** A concise summary explains the AI's findings and recommendations.
- **Multi-language Support:** The application supports analysis in both English and German.
- **Notification Management:** View, filter, and search through a list of PM notifications.
- **Detailed Notification View:** Access comprehensive details of individual notifications and trigger on-demand AI analysis.
- **Visual Score Indicator:** A clear visual indicator provides immediate feedback on the notification's quality score.

## UI/UX Overview

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and efficient, following standard SAP Fiori design principles. It provides a clear and structured way for users to interact with PM notifications and their quality analysis.

### Worklist View (Main Screen)

The initial screen of the application is the **Worklist View**, which serves as the central hub for managing notifications.

- **Notification List:** Displays a comprehensive list of PM notifications, showing key information at a glance (ID, description, priority, status, etc.).
- **Filtering:** A powerful filter bar allows users to narrow down the list based on various criteria such as short text, notification type, creator, functional location, equipment, and status.
- **Navigation:** Users can select a notification from the list to navigate to the detailed **Object View**.
- **Language Selection:** A language switcher allows users to toggle between English and German.

### Object View (Detail Screen)

The **Object View** provides a detailed look at a single PM notification. The information is organized into three tabs for clarity:

1.  **Notification Details Tab:**
    -   **Header:** Displays the notification's title, priority, and other key header data.
    -   **Status Timeline:** A visual timeline shows the progression of the notification's status (e.g., Outstanding, Released, Closed).
    -   **Detailed Information:** Provides a comprehensive overview of the notification's details, including functional location, equipment, dates, long text, and damage/cause codes.

2.  **Work Order Tab:**
    -   **Visibility:** This tab is only visible if a work order is associated with the notification.
    -   **Status Timeline:** A visual timeline for the work order's status.
    -   **Work Order Details:** Displays key information about the work order, such as ID, description, type, and dates.
    -   **Operations Table:** Lists all operations associated with the work order.

3.  **Quality Analysis Tab:**
    -   **AI-Powered Analysis:** This is the core feature of the application. When a notification is viewed, an AI-powered analysis is automatically triggered.
    -   **Quality Score:** A progress indicator displays the notification's quality score (0-100), with color-coding (red, yellow, green) for quick assessment.
    -   **Summary and Problems:** The analysis results include a summary of the findings and a list of identified problems.
    -   **"What-If" Analysis:** Users can edit the notification's long text in a text area and click a "Re-analyze" button to see how their changes would affect the quality score. This allows for interactive improvement of the notification.
    -   **Chat with Assistant:** A chat interface allows users to ask questions about the notification in natural language and receive AI-powered answers. This provides a conversational way to get more information and insights.

## Architecture Deep Dive

The application follows a client-server architecture, with a distinct separation between the backend and frontend components, deployed as a Multi-Target Application (MTA) on SAP BTP Cloud Foundry.

### Backend (Python/Flask)

The backend is a lightweight Flask application responsible for handling API requests and performing the core AI-driven text analysis.

- **Technology Stack:** Flask, Gunicorn, Pydantic, Google Gemini API.
- **Deployment Type:** Deployed as a standard Cloud Foundry application.
- **`main.py`**: The central Flask application file. It defines API routes (`/health` and `/api/analyze`).
- **`app/services/analysis_service.py`**: Integrates with the Google Gemini API (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`).
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies. Gunicorn is used as the production-grade WSGI server.
- **`manifest.yml`**: Defines the Cloud Foundry application properties. Crucially, it specifies the command to run the app with Gunicorn and declaratively defines the application's route.

### Frontend (SAP Fiori/UI5)

The frontend is an SAP Fiori application built with SAP UI5, providing an intuitive and enterprise-grade user interface.

- **Technology Stack:** SAP UI5, Node.js App Router.
- **Deployment Type:** The UI5 application's static content is embedded directly within the App Router's build artifact and served by the App Router itself. This robust pattern bypasses the need for the HTML5 Application Repository service.
- **`approuter/`**: Acts as the single entry point. It serves the static Fiori UI content and proxies API calls to the backend via the BTP Destination service.
- **`xs-app.json`**: Configures routing rules. It serves the Fiori app's content from a local directory (`localDir`) and proxies `/api` calls to the backend destination, preserving the API path prefix.

## ðŸ¤– Autonomous LLM Agent

This project includes a sophisticated, self-improving LLM agent designed to automate software development tasks. Inspired by the robust design principles for autonomous agents, it operates on a **Think â†’ Do â†’ Reflect â†’ Repair** cycle to autonomously plan, execute, and validate code changes.

### How It Works: The Reasoning Loop

The agent mimics a developer's workflow through a structured, multi-phase process. Each phase uses a dedicated prompt to interact with the Gemini LLM, ensuring that actions are deliberate and traceable.

1.  **Think Phase**:
    -   **Goal**: To understand a high-level user request (e.g., "Add a new feature") and break it down into a concrete, step-by-step technical plan.
    -   **Process**: The agent analyzes the existing codebase and the user's goal.
    -   **Output**: A structured plan, often involving which files to create or modify.
    -   **Prompt**: `agent/prompts/plan.prompt.md`

2.  **Do Phase**:
    -   **Goal**: To execute the plan by writing and modifying code.
    -   **Process**: The agent takes the plan from the "Think" phase and generates the necessary code changes, function by function, file by file.
    -   **Output**: New or updated source code files.
    -   **Prompt**: `agent/prompts/execute.prompt.md`

3.  **Reflect Phase**:
    -   **Goal**: To validate the changes and check for errors.
    -   **Process**: After the "Do" phase, the agent runs a suite of validation tools, such as linters, formatters, and automated tests.
    -   **Output**: A reflection on the success of the changes and the results from the validation tools.
    -   **Prompt**: `agent/prompts/reflect.prompt.md`

4.  **Repair Phase**:
    -   **Goal**: To automatically fix any issues discovered during the "Reflect" phase.
    -   **Process**: If a test fails or a linter finds an issue, the agent enters this phase. It analyzes the error messages and the code it just wrote to understand the mistake.
    -   **Output**: A new plan to fix the broken code, which starts the cycle over again.
    -   **Prompt**: `agent/prompts/repair.prompt.md`

### Example: Adding a "Copy to Clipboard" Button

Hereâ€™s how you would use the agent to add a new feature to the frontend.

**Goal**: Add a "Copy to Clipboard" button for the notification's long text on the detail page.

**Step 1: Think Phase**

First, give the agent the goal.

```bash
npm run agent -- run think --goal "On the Object view, add a 'Copy to Clipboard' button that copies the notification's long text."
```

The agent will analyze the goal and the Fiori application structure. It will determine that it needs to:
1.  Modify `pm-analyzer-fiori/webapp/view/Object.view.xml` to add a new `Button`.
2.  Modify `pm-analyzer-fiori/webapp/controller/Object.controller.js` to add an `onCopyLongText` event handler.

**Step 2: Do Phase**

Next, tell the agent to execute the plan.

```bash
npm run agent -- run do
```

The agent will now perform the file modifications:
-   **In `Object.view.xml`**, it will add a `<Button>` next to the long text display.
-   **In `Object.controller.js`**, it will add the `onCopyLongText` function, which gets the text from the model and uses the browser's clipboard API.

**Step 3: Reflect Phase**

Finally, ask the agent to reflect on its work.

```bash
npm run agent -- run reflect
```

The agent will run linters and any relevant tests. It will report that the code was added successfully and that no existing tests were broken. Since it's a UI feature that is difficult to unit test automatically, it would note that manual verification is recommended.

If there were a syntax error, the linter would fail, and the agent would proceed to the **Repair Phase** to fix it automatically.

### Agent CLI Commands

-   `npm run agent -- run think --goal "..."`: Starts a new task.
-   `npm run agent -- run do`: Executes the current plan.
-   `npm run agent -- run reflect`: Validates the last action.
-   `npm run agent -- run repair`: Attempts to fix a failed reflection.
-   `npm run agent -- state show`: Shows the agent's complete history for the current task.
-   `npm run agent -- state reset`: Clears the agent's memory.

### Agent Test Suite

The agent has its own Jest test suite to ensure its core logic is reliable.

```bash
npm test
```
This runs all tests in `agent/tests/` and generates a coverage report.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [SAP Cloud Foundry CLI](https://developers.sap.com/topics/cloud-foundry.html)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pm-notification-analyzer.git
    cd pm-notification-analyzer
    ```
2.  **Configure the backend:**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    - Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file.
    - Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to the `.env` file.
3.  **Run the backend:**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run the backend server
    python3 -m app.main
    ```
    The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:5001`.
4.  **Run the frontend:**
    In a new terminal window:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd pm-analyzer-fiori/

    # Install npm dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the frontend
    npm run start-noflp
    ```
    The frontend will now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry using a fully automated GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### Manual Post-Deployment Step

After the first deployment to a new SAP BTP subaccount, you must manually create an HTTP Destination. This tells the App Router how to find the backend.

- **Navigate To:** Your BTP Subaccount â†’ Connectivity â†’ Destinations
- **Name:** `pm-analyzer-backend` (must be exact)
- **Type:** `HTTP`
- **URL:** The URL of your deployed `pm-analyzer-backend` application.
- **Proxy Type:** `Internet`
- **Authentication:** `NoAuthentication`

## Configuration

### Backend

The backend requires a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable. For local development, you can create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. For production, this is set via the `cf set-env` command in the deployment workflow.

## Lessons Learned

- **Use a versioned SAPUI5 CDN:** This ensures the application always receives the latest secure patch for your chosen version.
- **Embed the UI in the Approuter:** This is a simpler and more robust deployment pattern than using the HTML5 Application Repository service.
- **Use a WSGI-compliant server:** A Flask (WSGI) application must be served by a WSGI-compliant server like Gunicorn.
- **Declaratively manage routes:** Always rely on the `manifest.yml` to declaratively manage routes.
- **Align App Router path rewriting:** The path rewriting logic in the App Router's `xs-app.json` must align perfectly with the backend's API route definitions.
- **Securely automate environment variables:** Never hardcode secrets. Use the platform's secret management for production environments.
